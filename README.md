# PredAlgoBC_WP1

PredAlgoBC is a MSCA-funded project for the search of biomarkers for breast cancer therapy.

WP1 aimed to implement a pipeline for cross-platform normalization between microarray and RNA-seq. We used TCGA dataas an example since it provides paired samples with both microarray and RNA-seq data
